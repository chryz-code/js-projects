  - How to run the program locally
  - If possible, add necessary links either leading to an article, a video or a documentation that is related to the codes available
  - Explain the functions of each codes available in the repository or directory
  - If necessary, add snippets of codes explaining things difficult to understand in the `README file` of the project
  - Writing of comments in the codes would be of real help
